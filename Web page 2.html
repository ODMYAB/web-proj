The Sun is about 93 million miles from Earth, and without its energy, life as we know it could not exist here on our home planet.The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. The Sun's volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it. Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris in orbit around it. The hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures top 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius). The Sun's activity, from its powerful eruptions to the steady stream of charged particles it sends out, influences the nature of space throughout the solar system.</p>

        <h2 style="color:rgb(56, 56, 56);">Formation</h2>
        <p>Our Sun together with the Solar System formed from a giant, rotating cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula, around 4.5 billion years ago. The Sun contains 99.8% of the mass of the entire Solar System.</p>

        <h2 style="color:rgb(56, 56, 56);">Size and Distance</h2>
        <p>Our Sun is a relatively medium-sized type of star. It has a radius of 695,508 km and a diameter of around 1.39 million kilometers. This is 109 times greater than the diameter of our planet. It is at 4.24 light-years away from us.</p>

        <p>Everything in the Solar System is located in the Milky Way galaxy. The Sun orbits the center of the Milky Way, bringing the planets, asteroids, comets, and other objects along with it.</p>

        <h2 style="color:rgb(56, 56, 56);">Structure</h2>
        <p>All stars are basically a ball of gas, and this is also true in regards to our Sun. The Sun is made out of 91% hydrogen and 8.9% helium. By mass, the Sun is about 70% hydrogen and 27% helium.</p>
