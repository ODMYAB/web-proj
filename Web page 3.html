Our solar system's eight planets come in two flavors: smaller rocky planets with solid ground and larger gas giants, so let's get to know them:</p>

            <h2 style="color: rgb(3, 41, 85);">Terrestrial Planets</h2>
            <p>Terrestrial planets are planets made up of rocks or metals with a hard surface. Terrestrial planets also have a molten heavy-metal core, few moons and topological features such as valleys, volcanoes and craters. 
            <br>In our solar system, there are four terrestrial planets, which also happen to be the four closest to the sun: </p>

                <li><div class="mercury">
                    <h3 style="color: black;">Mercury</h3>
                    <p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon, but despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system</p>

                <li><div class="venus">
                    <h3 style="color: black;">Venus</h3>
                    <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and Earth's closest planetary neighbor. Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. Its thick atmosphere is full of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, and it has clouds of sulfuric acid</p>

                    <h3 style="color: black;">Earth</h3>
                    <p>Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that's inhabited by living things. While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface.</p>

                <li><div class="mars">
                    <h3 style="color: black;">Mars</h3>
                    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun - a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past.</p>

            <h2 style="color: rgb(3, 41, 85);">Giant Planets</h2>
            <p>The giant planets constitute a diverse type of planet much larger than Earth. They are usually primarily composed of low-boiling-point materials, rather than rock or other solid matter, but massive solid planets can also exist. 
            <br>In our solar system, there are four Giant planets, just like the terrestrial, which are: </p>

                <li><div class="jupiter">
                    <h3 style="color: black;">Jupiter</h3>
                    <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system - more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. Jupiter's iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years. Jupiter is surrounded by dozens of moons. Jupiter also has several rings made of dust, not ice.</p>

                <li><div class="saturn">
                    <h3 style="color: black;">Saturn</h3>
                    <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system. Adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet to have rings - made of chunks of ice and rock - but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.</p>

                <li><div class="uranus">
                    <h3 style="color: black;">Uranus</h3>
                    <p>The seventh planet from the Sun with the third largest diameter in our solar system, Uranus is very cold and windy. The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 27 small moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin sideways, orbiting the Sun like a rolling ball.</p>

                    <h3 style="color: black;">Neptune</h3>
                    <p>Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system. More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye</p>
